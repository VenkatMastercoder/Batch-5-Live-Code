  <p>The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss
    inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808.
    The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor
    Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. One
    of the first cars affordable by the masses was the Ford Model T, begun in 1908, an American car manufactured by the
    Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and
    other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[4] The car is considered
    an essential part of the developed economy. </p>
